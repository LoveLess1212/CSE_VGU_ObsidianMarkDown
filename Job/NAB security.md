**Why would you apply for this security-focused StarCamp program and how it would contribute to your 3-5 year career plan?***

Please share with us your story and how technology or security has inspired you.

My fascination with technology began in my childhood when I experimented with Cheat Engine, trying to understand how software systems could be modified. This early curiosity led me to pursue Computer Science at university, initially with the goal of becoming a Software Engineer. During my studies, I became particularly interested in blockchain technology, due to the elegant application of cryptographic principles. However, this exploration revealed a crucial insight: security isn't just a feature of systems like blockchain â€“ it's the standard where all reliable software must be built upon. This realization shifted my career focus toward cybersecurity.

NAB's StarCamp presents an opportunity to transform my theoretical knowledge into practical expertise. While my university education provided me with a foundation in computer science principles and cryptography, I'm eager to learn how these concepts apply in protecting a major financial institution's infrastructure. Through StarCamp, I aim to build fundamental security engineering skills and understand enterprise security architecture, which will support my long-term aspiration of becoming a Cybersecurity consultant or auditor, where I can help organizations build robust security frameworks. NAB's international environment and structured learning approach would provide the perfect platform to begin this journey.

*
Please share with us what you want to improve/learn during and after joining StarCamp.

During the program, First, I expect to learn about all the essential technical skills that needed for this career path. Then I look forward to be exposure to real-world security challenges and experience working in enterprise-level operation to understand and develop a good security problem-solving mindset. Last but not least, I want to apply theoretical knowledge and helping senior on real security project. After the StarCamp, if best, I would like to stay with NAB to delivering new and innovative solution to NAB's customer with best practice of security.

1. Phishing Attacks These sophisticated social engineering attacks involve fraudulent emails that appear to be from legitimate sources, targeting employees across organizations. To protect against this threat, organizations should implement a dual-layer approach: first, deploying technical safeguards like email filtering systems and multi-factor authentication; second, conducting regular employee security awareness training to help staff identify and report suspicious emails.
2. DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) Attacks DDoS attacks can severely disrupt business operations by overwhelming servers and networks with malicious traffic, potentially leading to service outages. Protection requires a proactive security stance through implementing rate limiting to control traffic flow, deploying web application firewalls to filter malicious requests, and maintaining continuous network traffic monitoring to detect and respond to attacks early.

This multi-layered approach to security demonstrates how organizations must combine technical controls with human awareness and proactive monitoring to effectively protect their assets.
