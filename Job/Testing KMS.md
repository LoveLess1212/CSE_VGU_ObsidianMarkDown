Dear Hiring Manager, 
I am writing to express my strong interest in the Fresher Full-stack Test Engineer position at KMS Solutions. As a recent graduate with a consistently excellent academic record of 9.4 GPA throughout my four-year English-taught program, I bring a demonstrated commitment to excellence and a genuine passion for IT. My academic journey includes a 6-month scholarship exchange in Germany, where I only used English for both studies and communication, showcasing my strong language capabilities. Most recently, I demonstrated my testing expertise while developing smart contracts for a blockchain transition framework, where the immutable nature of blockchain technology demanded meticulous testing protocols. With my studies now complete, I am eager to contribute to KMS Healthcare's mission of solving healthcare's most challenging problems through innovative technology solutions and help build next-generation tools that improve patient care and healthcare delivery. Best regards, Toan
