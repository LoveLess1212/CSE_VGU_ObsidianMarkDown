Let's start the proof:
Let ε > 0 be given. We need to find an N such that for all n > N, |$a_n b_n - ab$| < ε.
We can rewrite |$a_n b_n - ab$| as follows:
|$a_n b_n - ab$| = |$a_n b_n - a_n b + a_n b - ab$|
≤ |$a_n b_n - a_n b$| + |$a_n b - ab$|  (by triangle inequality)
= |$a_n(b_n - b)$| + |$b(a_n - a)$|
Now, since {$a_n$} converges to a, there exists an $N_1$ such that for all n > $N_1$, |$a_n - a$| < $\frac{\epsilon}{2(|b|+1)}$
Similarly, since {$b_n$} converges to b, there exists an $N_2$ such that for all n > $N_2$, |$b_n - b$| < $\frac{\epsilon}{2(|a|+1)}$
Let N = max($N_1$, $N_2$). Then for all n > N:
|$a_n b_n - ab$| ≤ |$a_n(b_n - b)$| + |$b(a_n - a)$|
< |$a_n$|$\frac{\epsilon}{2(|a|+1)}$ + |$b$|$\frac{\epsilon}{2(|b|+1)}$
Now, we know that since {$a_n$} converges, it's bounded. So there exists an M such that |$a_n$| ≤ M for all n.
|$a_n b_n - ab$| < M$\frac{\epsilon}{2(|a|+1)}$ + |$b$|$\frac{\epsilon}{2(|b|+1)}$
≤ $\frac{\epsilon}{2}$ + $\frac{\epsilon}{2}$ = ε
Therefore, we have shown that for every ε > 0, there exists an N such that for all n > N, |$a_n b_n - ab$| < ε.

This proves that $\lim_{n\to\infty} (a_n b_n) = ab$.


- For step 5: We know that $\lim_{n\to\infty} a_n = a$. By the ε-δ definition of limits, this means that for any positive ε', we can find an N such that |$a_n - a$| < ε' for all n > N. In our proof, we specifically chose ε' = $\frac{\epsilon}{2(|b|+1)}$. This is a positive number (since ε > 0 and |b|+1 > 0), so we can apply the limit definition with this ε'.
- For step 6: Similarly, we know that $\lim_{n\to\infty} b_n = b$. Again, by the ε-δ definition, for any positive ε'', we can find an N such that |$b_n - b$| < ε'' for all n > N. Here, we chose ε'' = $\frac{\epsilon}{2(|a|+1)}$, which is also a positive number.

bởi vì Lim của $a_n$ tiến tới a, nên theo định nghĩa ta có thể tìm được 1 số $N_1$ sao cho $|a_{n}-a| < \epsilon^`$   với mọi số n > $N_1$ và bởi vì $\frac{\epsilon}{2(|b|+1)}$ là 1 số dương, nên mình có thể chọn ε' = $\frac{\epsilon}{2(|b|+1)}$. 

could you prove this sequence is convergent $a_{n}= \frac{1}{n+1} + \frac{1}{n+2} + \frac{1}{n+3} + ... + \frac{1}{n+n}$ 


Certainly! We can prove the convergence of this sequence without using integrals. Let's use a different approach involving inequalities and the concept of monotonic sequences. Here's a step-by-step proof:

1) First, let's rewrite our sequence:
   $a_n = \frac{1}{n+1} + \frac{1}{n+2} + \frac{1}{n+3} + ... + \frac{1}{n+n}$

2) We'll prove two things: that the sequence is decreasing and that it's bounded below by 0.

3) To show it's decreasing, let's compare $a_n$ and $a_{n+1}$:

   $a_{n+1} = \frac{1}{n+2} + \frac{1}{n+3} + ... + \frac{1}{n+n+1} + \frac{1}{2n+2}$

4) We can see that each term in $a_{n+1}$ is smaller than the corresponding term in $a_n$, and $a_{n+1}$ has one extra term. So:

   $a_{n+1} < a_n$ for all n

5) Now, let's show that $a_n$ is bounded below by 0:
   Clearly, each term $\frac{1}{n+k}$ is positive, so their sum is positive.

6) Next, let's find an upper bound. We can do this by comparing $a_n$ to $\frac{1}{2}$:

   $a_n = \frac{1}{n+1} + \frac{1}{n+2} + ... + \frac{1}{n+n}$
        < $\frac{1}{n} + \frac{1}{n} + ... + \frac{1}{n}$ (n terms)
        = $\frac{n}{n} = 1$

7) So we have: $0 < a_n < 1$ for all n

8) Now we can apply the Monotone Convergence Theorem: 
   If a sequence is monotonic (always decreasing or always increasing) and bounded, then it converges.

9) We've shown that $a_n$ is decreasing and bounded below by 0, so it must converge to some limit L where $0 \leq L < 1$.

Thus, we have proven that the sequence $a_n$ is convergent without using integrals.

Note: This proof doesn't give us the exact value of the limit (which we know from the integral method is $\ln(2)$), but it does prove convergence, which was the main goal.
