Is the simulation, in which the user is able to perform any action for any role, and thus can observe the execution from the perspective of all the users simultaneously. This contrasts with the experience of running a contract using a client, in which each participant sees the contract from their own point of view. In particular, participants are only able to interact with a running contract that is waiting for input from them; if that's not the case, then they will see that the contract execution is waiting from someone else's participation.
