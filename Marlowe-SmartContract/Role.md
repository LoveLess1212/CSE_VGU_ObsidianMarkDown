* represented by tokens and they are distributed to addresses at the time a contract is deployed to the [[Blockchain]]. After that, whoever has the token representing a [[Role]] is able to carry out the actions assigned to that [[Role]], and receive the payments that are issued to that [[Role]]
* This allows roles in running contracts to be traded between [[parties|participants]], through a mechanism of [[tokenization]]. This will be available in the on-chain implementation of [[Marlowe]] but the simulation in the Marlowe Playground simply presents contracts [[Role|roles]].
