* It also play a crucial roles in driving VGU's digital transformation process. This is also a big reason why I chose IT dept. Before Tet holiday I attended a workshop about VGU digital transformation process and the speech of Dr Vien, our vice president is so touching and encourages me to participate in the process.

4-5th slide
Next I will talk about my task and responsibility of me during the internship.
To start with, let look at the SDLC here, The part that I participated in was Mainly about development part on the Database backend and frontend, with a little bit on design, where I redesign the ERD, also with a little of TEsting - QA. 
First when I joined the Internship, The first thing I have to do is task planning where I have to plan which week I have to do which task in the backlog but later on as I have to adopt new responsibility to make sure the application meet the deadline of the stakeholders so the gannt chart for now is become a little irrelevant. About the new responsibility that I have to adopted, that I because when I first join the project, I worked as Backend intern however, I was done my part quite ahead of time, and one of the member of the project quited bcs personal issue. So my supervisor decided to let me have more task in the database and frontend also to make sure we met the deadline.
