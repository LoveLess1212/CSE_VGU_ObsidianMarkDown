## Release and Response time
* Release time: the instant in time when a job becomes available for execution
	* May not be exact: *release time jitter* so $r_i$ is in the interval $[r_i^-,r_i^+]$
	* A job can be scheduled and executed at **any time at, or after**, its release time
* Response time: The length of time from the release time of the job to the time instant when it completes
