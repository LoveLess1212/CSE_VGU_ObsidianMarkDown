## Deadlines and Timing constraints
*  Completion time: the instant at which a job completes execution 
* Relative deadline ($D_i$): the maximum allowable job response time
* Absolute deadline ($d_i$): the instant of time by which a job is required to be completed (often called simply the deadline)
	* absolute deadline = release time + relative deadline
	* *Feasible interval* for a job $J_i$ is the interval $(r_i,d_i]$
* Deadlines are examples of timing constraints
