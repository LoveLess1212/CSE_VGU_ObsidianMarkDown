* **Best known fixed-priority algorithm** is rate monotonic scheduling
* Assigns *priorities* to tasks based on their *period*
	* **The shorter the period, the higher the priority**
	* The rate (of job releases) is the inverse of the period, so jobs with higher rate have  higher priority
* Very widely studied and used
