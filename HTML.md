The Module Operating system, SWE Design, Programming exercise was started 2 weeks before the DAAD group came back to Vietnam. Furthermore,it was not until 21/03 that we were able to form the team to did the module (1 month late in compare to other group).
The module, SWE Design have 2 register form for the exam, which are very confusing & there are a lot of student missed the exam just because of that.
Furthermore, we received module register form for a lot of module that we are not even able to enroll. I know it was a mistake and already followed up by a confirmation email, but there is A LOT of it.
