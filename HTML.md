The Module Operating system, SWE Design, Programming exercise was started 2 weeks before the DAAD group came back to Vietnam. Furthermore,it was not until 21/03 that we were able to form the team to did the module (1 month late in compare to other group).
The module, SWE Design have 2 register form for the exam, which are very confusing & there are a lot of student missed the exam just because of that.
Furthermore, we received module register form for a lot of module that we are not even able to enroll. I know it was a mistake and already followed up by a confirmation email, but there is A LOT of it.


4.1 The quality of the lecture rooms /lecture halls.
* Our only lecture room is 410, there are a lot of broken chairs there, the mic is always out of battery, even with battery, it still make very weird noise that disrupt the lecture every time.
4.2 The quality of the computer rooms.
* We never have the chance to use it 
4.4 The quality of the canteen's facilities.
* is there a canteen ?
4.5 The quality of facilities for sports and recreation.
* The fee for renting the soccer field is overpriced, There's wind in the indoor sport hall that make it very hard to play badminton.
4.6 The IT infrastructure, especially the wifi (except for the dorm area).
* The wifi is unusable in the library and computer lab.
4.7 The quality of the dorm's facilities.
* There're always false alarms, 


7.6 Provision of academic certificates and other documents has been accurate:
* The scholarship money was reduced after applied for the scholarship.

1. Initialize a variable (`point`) to 0. This variable will store the index of the first year when the user's savings exceed their money needs.
2. Iterate over the years left in the user's life. For each year:
    1. Calculate the difference between the savings and the money needed for the year and store it in the corresponding element of the `FreedomPoint` array.
    2. If the difference is greater than 0, set `point` to the current index and break the loop.
3. Return the age at which the user reaches their financial freedom point by adding `point` to the user's current age.
