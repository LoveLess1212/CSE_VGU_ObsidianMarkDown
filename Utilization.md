* The ratio $u_{i}= \frac{e_i}{p_i}$ is the utilization of task $T_i$
	* The fraction of time of a [[Periodic tasks]] with period $p_i$ and [[Execution time]] $e_i$ keeps a processor busy
* The total utilization of a system is the sum of the utilizations of all tasks in a system: $U = \sum{u_i}$ 
* We will usually assume the relative deadline for the jobs in a task is equal to the period of the task
	* It can sometimes be shorter than the period, to allow slack time
* Many useful, real-world, systems fir this model; and it is easy to reason about such periodic tasks
