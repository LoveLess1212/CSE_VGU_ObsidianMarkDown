I am particularly drawn to ShopBack because it offers me the chance to be a part of a platform that serves 45 million customers in Asia-Pacific and handles over half a million transactions every day. My experience developing a full-stack booking application that serves over 100 users demonstrates my ability to build stable and performant systems, while my role as a Teaching Assistant for multiple computer science courses showcases my deep understanding of software engineering fundamentals. Combined with my strong academic record (GPA: 9.4/10) and hands-on experience with various programming technologies, I am confident I can help ShopBack continue to revolutionize the way people shop while adhering to the company's core DNA of Grit, Hunger, Speed, Impact, and Growth.

commitment to excellence and self-improvement and IT passion through the fact that I could consistently maintain my excellent GPA throughout the years 9.4 GPA. I have already graduate so I could fully commit to the job without any distraction. I study 4 year university in English, along with 6 month scholarship exchange in Germany (using mainly english for both study and communication). On my last project, I worked on developing smart contracts for a business and blockchain transition framework which require a lot of testing becauseof the immutability of blockchain.
