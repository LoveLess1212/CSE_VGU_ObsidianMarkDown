* The dispatcher carries out the state trans of the processes
	 * **During [[process]] switching**, the **dispatcher** **removes** the **CPU** from the **(present ) running [[process]]** and **assigns** it to the **(new) [[process]]**, which is the **first** one **in the queue** (**another [[process]]**)
	 * For transitions between the states ready and blocked, the dispatcher removes the corresponding [[process]] control blocks from the status lists and accordingly inserts them new> Transitions form or to the state running always imply a  switch of the [[process]], which is currently executed by the CPU
