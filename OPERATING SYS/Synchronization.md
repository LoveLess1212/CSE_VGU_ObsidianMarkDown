> [!Summary: Difference between Signaling and Blocking]
> **Signaling:** specifies the execution order
> *Ex:* Execute section X of process Pa before section Y of Pb
> **Blocking / Locking** secures [[Critical Sections]]
> The execution order of the [[Critical Sections]] of the processes is not specified! It is just ensured that the execution of [[Critical Sections]] does not overlap
