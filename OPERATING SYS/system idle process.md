Windows operating systems since Windows NT ensure that the CPU is assigned to a process at any time
If **no process** is in the state ready, **the** *system idle process* gets the **CPU** **assigned**>The **system idle process** is **always active** and has the **lowest priority**
Due to the **system idle process**, the *scheduler must never consider the case that no active process exists*
> Since windows 2000, the system idle process puts the CPU into a power-saving mode For each CPU core, exists a system idle process
