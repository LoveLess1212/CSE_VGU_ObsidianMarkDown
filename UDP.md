# User Datagram Protocol
- A **datagram** is an **independent**, **self-contained message** sent over the network whose arrival, arrival time, and content are not guaranteed.
- A datagram sent by UDP is transmitted from a sending process to a receiving process **without acknowledgement or retries**.
- If a failure occurs, the message may not arrive.
