Certainly! I'll provide you with a basic structure for ProviderTokens and UserTokens, explain why they might be better as native tokens, and discuss where to store provider data.

Let's start with the [[validator]] for these tokens:

Aiken [[Validator]] for ProviderTokens and UserTokens

This [[validator]] manages both ProviderTokens and UserTokens. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

1. It allows minting and burning of both token types, but only by the admin.
2. It mints exactly one token per operation for both providers and users.
3. It allows the transfer of UserTokens but not ProviderTokens.

Now, let's address your questions:

1. Why should these be native tokens instead of normal tokens?

Native tokens in Cardano have several advantages for this use case:

a) Security: Native tokens are secured by the same underlying consensus mechanism as ADA, making them inherently secure.

b) Uniqueness: Each [[native token]] is uniquely identified by its policy ID and token name, ensuring no conflicts between different applications.

c) Efficiency: Native tokens are treated similarly to ADA by the protocol, making transactions involving these tokens efficient.

d) Standardization: Using native tokens ensures compatibility with wallets and other applications in the Cardano ecosystem.

e) Simplicity: Native tokens don't require separate smart contracts for basic operations like minting, burning, and transferring.

2. Where should we store the info-data of the Provider?

While the token itself doesn't store detailed information, you have several options for storing provider data:

a) On-chain metadata: You can associate metadata with transactions that mint ProviderTokens. This data is stored on the [[blockchain]] but has size limitations.

b) Off-chain database with on-chain hash: Store detailed provider information off-chain (e.g., in IPFS or a centralized database) and include only a hash of this data on-chain. This allows for more extensive data storage while maintaining a verifiable link on the [[blockchain]].

c) [[Smart contract]] storage: Create a separate [[smart contract]] that stores provider information. The ProviderToken would then serve as a key to access or modify this data.

Here's a simple example of how you might structure a [[smart contract]] for storing provider data:

This contract allows storing and managing provider data on-chain. The ProviderToken could be used as the `provider_id` in this contract, creating a link between the token and the stored data.

By using this combination of native tokens and smart contracts, you can create a flexible and secure system for managing providers and users in your application. The native tokens serve as unique identifiers and access keys, while the smart contracts handle the more complex data storage and logic.

Now, let's break down the main components and their purposes:

1. `ProviderData` type: This defines the structure of data associated with each provider. It includes the provider's name, type of service, and contact information.
2. `State` type: This represents the current state of the contract. It's a dictionary that maps provider IDs (likely the hash of their ProviderToken) to their associated data.
3. `Action` type: This defines the possible actions that can be performed on the contract:
    - `AddProvider`: Add a new provider with their data
    - `UpdateProvider`: Update an existing provider's data
    - `RemoveProvider`: Remove a provider from the contract
4. `manage_provider_data` function: This is the main [[validator]] function. It takes the current state, an action to perform, and the transaction context. It then:
    - Determines which action is being performed
    - Modifies the state accordingly (add, update, or remove provider data)
    - Ensures that the transaction is signed by the admin
5. `is_signed_by_admin` function: This is a helper function that checks if the transaction is signed by the admin. It does this by comparing the transaction signatories with the admin's [[public key]] hash.

The overall flow of this contract is:

1. When a transaction is submitted to interact with this contract, the `manage_provider_data` function is called.
2. Based on the `Action` provided, it either adds a new provider, updates an existing provider's data, or removes a provider.
3. For all actions, it checks that the transaction is signed by the admin using the `is_signed_by_admin` function.
4. If the action is valid and signed by the admin, the contract state is updated accordingly.

This structure allows for secure management of provider data on-chain, ensuring that only the admin can modify the data while maintaining a record of all providers in the system.
