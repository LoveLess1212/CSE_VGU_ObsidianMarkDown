_Native tokens_ is a feature that enables the transacting of multi-assets on [Cardano](https://cardano.org/). Users can transact with ada, and an unlimited number of user-defined (custom) tokens natively.

Native support offers distinct advantages for developers: there is no need to create smart contracts to handle custom tokens, for example, which removes a layer of added complexity and potential for manual errors since the ledger handles all token-related functionality.

The native tokens feature extends the accounting infrastructure defined in the ledger model (originally designed for processing ada-only transactions) to accommodate transactions using a range of assets. These assets include ada and a variety of user-defined custom token types.
