- The failure model defines the **ways** in which **failures may occur** in order to provide an understanding of the effects of failures.
    - [[Omission failures]]: a process or communication channel fails to perform actions that it is supposed to do.
    - Arbitrary failures: any type of error may occur. It may produce arbitrary responses at arbitrary times.
