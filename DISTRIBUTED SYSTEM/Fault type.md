- [[A transient faul]]: occurs once and then dissappears
    E.g., A bird flying through the beam of a microwave transmitter may cause lost bits on some network. If the transmission retries, it will probably work.
- [[A intermittent fault]]: occurs, then vanishes of its own accord, the reappear, and so on.
    E.g., a loose contact on a connector will often cause an intermittent fault.
- [[A prenament fault]]: continues to exist until the faulty component is replaced.
    E.g., Burnt-out chips, software bugs, and disk-head crashes
