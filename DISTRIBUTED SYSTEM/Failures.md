- In a distributed system both **processes** and **communication channels** may **fail**.
- Fault tolerance (a system can provide its services even in the presence of faults) is a strong requirement in a distributed system, including
    - Availability: the system will most likely be **working** at a given  **instant in time**.
    - Reliability: the system can run **continuously** without failure.
    - Safety: the situation that when a system temporarily fails to operate correctly, **no catastrophic** event happens.
    - Maintainability: **how easily** a failed system can be **repaired**
