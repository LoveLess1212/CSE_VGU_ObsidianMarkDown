- A **datagram** is an **independent**, **self-contained message** sent over the network whose arrival, arrival time, and content are not guaranteed.
- A datagram sent by UDP is transmitted from a sending process to a receiving process **without acknowledgement or retries**.
- If a failure occurs, the message may not arrive.

$y_{1}$
$=y_{0}+\frac{h}{2}(t_{0}^{2}\sqrt{y_{0}}+t_{1}^{2}\sqrt{y_{0}+ht_{1}^{2}\sqrt{y_{0}}})$
$=4+\frac{1}{2}(1^2\sqrt{4}+1^2\sqrt{4+1\cdot1^2\sqrt{4}})$
$\approx4+2/5=6.5$
