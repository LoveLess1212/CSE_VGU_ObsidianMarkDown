- Models **shares** some **fundamental properties**
    E.g. one computer commnunicates with another by sending messages over a computer network
- Fundamental models
    - **Description** of the **properties** that are **common** in all **architectural models**.
- Algorithm
    - A **sequence of steps** to be taken in order to perform a desired computation.
- Distributed algorithm
    - A definition of the **steps** to be **taken by each of the processes** of which the system is composed, including the transmission of messages between them
- Three basic types
    - Interaction model
        Computation occurs within processes that interact by **passing message**.
    - Failure model
        A **fault** occurs in any of the computers on which it runs or in the network that connects them.
    - Security model
        - **Attacks** by both **external** an **internal** agents.
