* The goal is to help to organize and interpret data
# Data
* The measurements obtained in experiment/research study
## Types
* Categorical
* Numerical
	* Discrete - number of children, defects per h (int)
	* Continuous - weight- Voltage (doule)
# Population
* The entire group of individuals 
## Sample
* Usually populations are so large that a researcher cannot examine the entire group. -> a sample is selected to represent the population in a research study. The goal is to use the results obtained from the sample to help ans ques about the pop
### Random Sampling
* Is a procedure
	* Each member of the pop is chosen strictly by change
	* Each member of the pop is equally likely to be chosen
	* Every possible sample of *n* objects is equally likely to be chosen
# Variability - the spread of data
* By variability, we mean successive observations of a system or phenomenon do not produce exactly the same result
* We all encounter variability in our everyday lives and statistical thinking can give us a useful way to in corporate this variability into our decision making processes
* Statistics gives us a framework for describing this variability and for learning about potential sources of variability
## Mechanistic model
* Built from our underlying knowledge
## Empirical
* Built from experience
* Function that is use empirical is called priori

# [[Descriptive Statistics]]
## [[statistical interference]]
>[!statistical interference]
>The process of reasoning from a sample of objects to conclusions for a populations of objects was referred to as 

## [[Probability models]]
* Help quantify the risks involved in statistical inference, that is risks involved in decisions made every day.

* Probability provides framework for the study and application of statistics
