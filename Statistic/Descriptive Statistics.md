# Diff Bw [[Descriptive Statistics]]  and Inferential Statistics 
## Descriptive statistics
* Graphical and numerical procedures to summarize and process data
	* Collect data
	* Present data
	* Summarize data
>[!goal]
>Organize and simplify the data so that it is possible to get a general overview of the results
## Inferential Statistics 
* Using data to make predictions, forecast and estimates to assist decision making

# Stem-and-Leaf Diagram
* divide each score into two parts: a stem, consisting of one or more of the leading digits and a leaf, consisting of the remaining digits
* List the stem values in a vertical column
* Write the units for stems and leaves on the display

## Frequency Distribution Graphs
* In a frequency distribution graphs, the data categories are listed on the X axis and the frequencies are listed on the Y axis
* When the data categories consist of numerical data from an interval or ratio scale, the graph should be either a histogram or a polygon.
### Histogram 
* ![[Pasted image 20230408110902.png]]
### Polygon
* a dot is centered above each data point so that the height of the dot corresponds to the freq. The dots are then connected by straight lines. An additional line is down at each end to bring the grpah back to a zero frequency

### Bar
* Is histogram without gap bw bars

# Central Tendency
* In general terms, central tendency is a statistical measure that determines a single value that accurately describes the center of the distribution 
* The goal of central tendency is to identify the single value that is the best representative for the entire set of data
## Mean
* The mean is the most commonly used measure of central tendency
* Computation of the mean requires data that are numerical values measured on an interval or ratio scale
> If the n observations in a smaple are denoted by x1,x2.. xn,, the sample mean is
> $x = \frac{x1+x2+x3+...+xn}{n}$
* The mean is the balance point of the distribution because the sum of the distances below the mean is exactly equal to the sum of the distances above the mean
> Although the mean is the most commonly used measure of central tendency, there are situations where the mean does not provide a good, representative value, and there are situations where you cannot compute a mean at all.
> When a distribution contains a few extreme values, the mean will be pulled toward the extremes. In this case, the mean will not provide a "central " value

## Median
* If the data in a distribution are listed in order from smallest to largest, the median is defined as the midpoint 

>[!5 number]
>Smallest value 
>First Quartile
>Median 
>Third quartile 
>Largest value 

## Mode
* The most frequently occurring ring data point in the distribution 
* In a freq distribution graph, the mode is the data point corresponding to the peak or high point of the distribution 
* It is possible for a distribution to have more than one mode. Such a distribution is called bimodal
* In addition, the term "mode" is often used to describe a peak in a distribution that is not really the highest point. Thus, a distribution may have a major mode at the highest peak and at a minor mode at a secondary peak in a different location

## Box Plots
* The box plot is a graphical display that simultaneously describes several important features of a data set, such as center, spread, departure from symmetry, and identification of observations that lie unusually far from the bulk of the data
