- By itself, a raw data-point or X value provides very little information about how that particular data point compares with other values in the distribution
	- For example, a data point of X =7 may be a relatively low data point, or an average data point, or an extremely high data point depending on the mean and std deviation for the distribution from which the data point was obtained
- If the raw data point is transformed into a z-score, however the value of the z-score tells exactly where the data point is located relative to all the others in the distribution
- the process of changing an X value into a z-score involves creating a signed number, called z-score, such that
	- The sign of the z-score identifies whether the X value is located above the mean or below the mean
	- The numerical value of the z-score corresponds to the number of standard deviations between X and the mean of the Distribution
