## Sample Spaces
* The set of all possible outcomes Ã² a random experiment is called the sample space, S.
* S is **discrete** if it consists of a finite or countable infinite set of outcomes .
* S is **continuous** if it contains an interval of real numbers
## Events are Sets of Outcomes
* An event (E) is *a subset* of the sample space of a random experiment
* Because events are subsets, we can use basic set operation
	* Union
	* Intersection
	* Complement
