*Who should read this*: NEW SL - INF squad
## Term
* FOB: **F**orward **O**perating **B**ase aka. the Radio
* HAB: **H**ESCO **A**ccommodation **B**unkers aka. Hideouts, spawnpoint
* SL: **S**quad **L**eader
* logi: The Logi truck :)) the truck with 3 strip of ammo when shown on the map
## How to put it down - methodically
### Prerequisite 
* Be a SL
* A logi vehicle within 30m with atleast 600 construction.
- An additional **team** member within 30m.
	- Lead Crewman and Lead Pilots require **three** teammates nearby.
* At least 150 meters from main.
- At least 400 meters from other friendly radios.
- On smaller maps, only 300 meters are required.
### Step
1. Find a good spot on the map
2. Put down a radio creation mark - to check if it placeable
3. Ask the commander - another INF (if possible)
4. Go to the point
5. Put down the radio
	1. (optional) If you are dropping it in the danger zone - no info zone, you should put the rally next to (<30m) from the radio 
6. Hide the logi ( ask s.o in your squad to do that), but make sure the logi is not next to the radio
7. Do anything you want with it
## Bonus - Tip
* Should only place the FOB about 150m-400m from the objective - the further, the less efficient - the closer the higher chance it be proxied within minutes
* Never place the HAB - FOB on the Objective or on the line between two objective ( except some special point)
* Destroy irrelevant FOB - abandoned fob is a suicidal time bom even the old defensive FOB count
* Do not FOB spamming, 1 defensive and 1-2 attacking FOB + rallies is enough.

P.s: 
* This is a basic guide, there are more advanced tactics and strategy to place the FOB, but this is a good start.
* Most of the idea is gathered & from my experience in the game, If you have any more idea, feel free to add it.
