* SLAM is a self-contained, autonomous and trusted framework for continuous [[SLA]] monitoring in a multi-cloud environment that is [[blockchain]]-based and employs smart contracts to discover [[SLA]] breaches
* [[Blockchain]] technology would help monitor SLAs and improve service trust in cloud computing. Similar solutions may be found in fog computing, edge computing and 5G, 6G networks. Viewing the [[blockchain]] as a trusted ledger that records all service attributes, a [[blockchain]]-based recommendation system and an auditing solution to protect 5G consumer data are prominent.
