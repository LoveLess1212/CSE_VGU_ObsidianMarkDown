In service computing, [[SLA]] description languages have gained a lot of research attention. Due to the lack of technological support, executing an [[SLA]] that has been agreed upon by the provider and its consumers without human intervention remains one of the most challenging question. Before we entered the digital transformation era, the mainstream thought on the subject was to introduce a regulatory entity whose main job is to monitor and referee service provisioning

# Research question
* The penalties specified in a dynamic [[SLA]] dictate what the provider and its customers should do in the event of a dispute. To make these rules computer-interpretable, in what ground logic or formal languages shall we express them.
* How to digitize penalty-aware [[SLA]]s to enable an enforcement mechanism and the computation of an objective unbiased reputation in service provisioning?
* How to gear up a distributed ledger to enforce relevant penalty rules during a service transaction.
