* The concept of trust is the heart of blockchain. Consensus is the mechanism that facilitates the utopian aspect of blockchain by providing a means for disparate parties to transact without the necessary trust provided by intermediaries prevalent in today's transactional systems.
* Another way to think about consensus is this: every time you use your credit card, several intermediaries are involved, each performing a specific function and collecting a fee which you are paying for in addition to the amount of your purchase. You may not see the fees, but they are build into the transaction either implicitly or explicitly, and you are paying for them. In blockchain, the mech of consensus performs this function of trust, void of intermediaries.
* Consensus has many implementations. Each is designed to provide trust based on probaility. This prob is a function of agreement. Complete agreement is difficult to attain and requires a lot  of time and resources, while partial agreement is faster and requires fewer resources, but is risky. How much risk is used to reach agreement. Seldom, if ever, can prob of agreement be 1 or 100%, and often less than 100% is acceptable. Many consensus algorithm exist, and new algorithms are continuously begin designed. You should understand four: Proof of work, proof of stake, practical Byzantine fault tolerance, and proof of elapsed time.

*  The problem with old storage systems that are not integrated with blockchain technology is primarily related to issues of trust, [[transparency]], security, and efficiency. Here are some specific problems associated with traditional storage systems:

1. Lack of [[Transparency]]: Traditional storage systems often lack [[transparency]] regarding the ownership, history, and condition of stored items. This creates a trust gap between storage providers and customers, as there is limited visibility into the movement and handling of stored goods.
    
2. Centralized Control: Many old storage systems rely on centralized authorities or intermediaries to manage storage facilities and transactions. This centralized control introduces a single point of failure and increases the risk of data manipulation, unauthorized access, or loss of stored items.
    
3. Limited Security: Old storage systems may have vulnerabilities in terms of security and data protection. Without robust security measures, there is a higher risk of theft, damage, or unauthorized access to stored items.
    
4. Lack of Accessibility: Traditional storage systems may have limited accessibility options, especially when it comes to remote access or sharing stored items with others. This can hinder convenience and collaboration for individuals or businesses relying on storage services.
    
5. Inefficient Processes: Manual paperwork, documentation, and coordination can make storage processes time-consuming and error-prone. Lack of automation and integration with other systems can lead to inefficiencies, delays, and increased administrative overhead.
    
6. Difficulty in Verification: Verifying the authenticity, ownership, and integrity of stored items can be challenging with old storage systems. There may be a lack of reliable documentation or audit trails, making it difficult to resolve disputes or verify the history of stored goods.
    

By integrating blockchain technology into storage systems, these problems can be addressed. Blockchain provides benefits such as:

- [[Transparency]]: Blockchain's decentralized and transparent nature allows for a tamper-resistant record of storage transactions, ensuring [[transparency]] and trust between storage providers and customers.
    
- Security: Blockchain's cryptographic algorithms and consensus mechanisms enhance the security of stored data, reducing the risk of unauthorized access, tampering, or data loss.
    
- Ownership and Traceability: Blockchain enables the recording of ownership rights and the traceability of stored items, providing a verifiable and immutable record of the history and provenance of goods.
    
- Smart Contracts: By using smart contracts, storage agreements can be automated and self-executing, eliminating the need for intermediaries and streamlining storage processes.
    
- Accessibility and Sharing: Blockchain technology can facilitate secure and permissioned access to stored items, enabling seamless sharing and collaboration between authorized parties.
    
- Efficiency and Automation: Blockchain's automation capabilities, combined with integration with other systems, can streamline storage processes, reduce manual work, and improve overall efficiency.
    

By integrating blockchain technology, old storage systems can overcome these limitations, providing enhanced trust, security, [[transparency]], and efficiency for both storage providers and customers.
