* Performance
	* Localize critical operations and minimize communications. Use large rather than fine-grain components
* Security
	* Use a [[layered]] architecture with critical assets in the inner layers.
* Safety
	* Localize safety-critical features in a small number of sub-systems
* Availability
	* Include redundant components and mechanisms for fault tolerance
* Maintainability
	* Use fine-grain, replaceable components.
