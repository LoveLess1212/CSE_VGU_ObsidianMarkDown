## Definition:
> 	- Requirement Analysis is interdisciplinary function mediates bw acquirer and supplier to establish and maintain the requirements to be met by the system, software or service of interest.
> 	- Cover almost everything :V. The result of req engineering is a hierachy of requirement that:
> 		- Enables an agreed understanding bw stakeholders
> 		- is validated against real world needs, can be implemented.
> 		- Provides a  basis of verifying design and accepting solutions.
> 	- The hierachy of req may be represented in one or more req specification
## Importance
* Deliver optimal value to customer
- more effort -> more cost
- this implies a clear enough *understanding* of the customer's *problem* to *build* a *solution* which *provides* an *optimal return on investment.*
* Up to 60% of expensive software failure originate from misunderstanding of requirements.
## Challenges
* Customers have *difficulties to clearly describe* their need ->> the problem *not fully understood* -> *wrong description* of requirements
* Customers request *incremental improvement*
*  **important** to fully understand the req **before** the implement start
* The req analysis process is very *Project specific* and need *communication*
* *different vocab*
* Customers often have *idea about solution* but can't fully analyze -> *do what customer needs* **not** *what they want*
## Requirements Types
### Functional Requirement
	Describe the funcitonality of the system
### Non Functional Req
	 Constrain the solution - often known as quality or performace requirements.
## Engineering Requirements
### WHY
* the basis for any *downstream*
* Must be *correct and complete
* Errors in the requirements are *costly*
* development team often *communicates* with customer via req
* important to *engineer* or research req *together with customer*:
	* User know what they *have*, not what they *need*. Theire needs are constantly changeing
	* Users will better understand what they need after they see *prototype*
	* 
### HOW
* Customers think in their *business terms* not in *software engineer terms*
* #software_analyst needs to:
	* Study the customer's *application domain* 
	* Learn *Business language* 
	* Understand 
		* how the relevant *business processes* look like and model them
		* which step customers want to *keep or change 
		* which process the SW must *process*
## Measurable
> Requirements need to be *measurable* in order to be implemented and tested successfully
* in a 1st step, req can be engineered without measure. This refinement can be done in a sec step,, once there is agreement on overall req*
### Validation
* before implement, done through review or test case
* For each req, it need to be checked in a first step:
	* The *business benefit* is clearly staged and quantified
	* who will use
	* approval process
* Ask
	* Therefore it helps to ask the following questions:  
	* Who has requested the work?  
	* Who will use the solution?  
	* What will be the economic benefit?  
	* What alternatives to this project exist?  
	* Who has to approve this project?  
	* Has there a budget been reserved already

# Requirement specification
## Documentation
* can be discussed verbally -> documented.
## Structure
## Modeling
There are *2 Approach*
1. Atomic req
	* spec is a single requirement, which is measurable, testable, traceable, and detailed enough -> no further breakdown needed
	* Document = many atomic
2. Flow or process  oriented requirements
	* Use case = *List of actions or step
	* Document = *collection of several use cases
	* well for *Agile* development processes
# Use cases
* Is a *textual description*
* help to discover *requirement*
* Both should be understand This
* 1 use case = 1 req. Document = many use case.
* need to be *super detailed*describe in case of *norm use and failure*
