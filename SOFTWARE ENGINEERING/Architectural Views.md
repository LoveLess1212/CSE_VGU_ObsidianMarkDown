* What views or perspectives are useful when designing and documenting a system's architecture?
* What notations should be used for describing architectural models?
* Each architectural model only shows one view or perspective of the system
	* How a system is decomposed into modules
	* how the run-time processes interact
	* system components are distributed across a network

# 4+1 View model of software architecture -> UML
* Logical view: Shows the key abstractions in the system as objects or classes.
	* Class diagram, communication diagram, (sequence diagram)
* Process view: shows how, at run-time the system is composed of interacting processes.
	* Activity diagram, sequence diagram
* Implementation (Physical)  view: Shows how the software is decomposed for development.
	* Deployment diagram
* Development view: Shows the system hardware and how software components are distributed across the processors in the system
	* Component diagram, Package diagram
