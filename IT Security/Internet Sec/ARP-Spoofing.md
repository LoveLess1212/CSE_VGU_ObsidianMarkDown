* ARP spoofing, is a technique by  which an attacker sendS(spoofed) ARP messages onto a local are network to associate the attackers' [[MAC address]] with the IP address of another host, such as the default gateway, causing any traffic meant for that IP address to be sent to the attacker instead.
* This allows the attacker to intercept traffic meant for the target host, and even modify the traffic before forwarding it to the target host.
