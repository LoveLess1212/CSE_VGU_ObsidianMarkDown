## What can happen
* Unauthorized 3rd party staying somewhere over the party can
	* Intercept the traffic between the sender and the receiver, 
	* Manipulate: whatever the sender is sending to the receiver, the communication could be altered, changed by them
	* Spoof: Impersonate the sender, the receiver cannot distinguish between the sender and unauthorized third party
	* Disrupt: if you cannot hack it, break it. They can disrupt communication
