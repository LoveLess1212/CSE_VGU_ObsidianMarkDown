* Zero-day exploit: a type of exploit that takes advantage of a security vulnerability on the same day that the vulnerability becomes generally known (zero-day). [[Zero-day]]
* A zero-day attack happens once that flaw, or software/hardware vulnerability, is exploited and attackers release malware before a developer has an opportunity to create a patch to fix the vulnerability—hence “zero-day.”
