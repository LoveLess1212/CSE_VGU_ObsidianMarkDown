> IT Security is the protection of information and information systems against unauthorized access and modification and availability of information system services for legitimate users, including measures to thwart, discover or log threats.
> Protection against unauthorized  access must be ensured during storage, processing or in transit

Protect **Information & Information system** against unauthorized access and modification - Ensure availability for legitimate users, including measures to thwart, discover or log threats.
this protection must be ensured during Storage - processing - or in transit
# Why
* [[IT Security]] is an important economic factor
* Data is mostly stored and retrieved and processed electronically
* Protection of information and information systems is required in order to protect this valuable asset
# Aims
* Confidentiality
	* Protection against unauthorized access
* Integrity
	* Protection against unauthorized modification

* Availability 
	* Resources and Services are available for legitimate users
* Authenticity and [[authentication]]
	* Unambiguous(clear) identification of the sender of information or a communication peer
* Nonrepudiation
	* Ability to prove that a given message was sent and by whom to a third party not involved in communication
* Authorization
	* Access to resources is limited to certain group of (authenticated) users
# Attacks on IT Security
* Passive Attacks
	* Attacker does not actively participate
	* Example: Snooping and wiretapping
	* Difficult to discover 
	* Preventive means of protection against active attacks
* Active Attacks
	* Attacker actively manipulates systems or data
	* Manipulation of data or systems
	* Attacker often leaves traces
	* Prevention and Detection possible
# Vulnerabilities
* Successful attacks require vulnerabilities . Can be caused by
	* Error in requirements
		* E.g., [[IT Security]]  not taken into consideration
	* Error in design
		* e.g., wrong specification
	* Error in the implementation
		* e.g., erroneous implementation of a correct specification'
	* Installation and administration errors
		* e.g., switching off a necessary security feature
# Aims of an Attack
* Heavily depends on attacker
* Early on nerds and geeks, today criminals
* Insider and outsider
# Risk and Uncertainty
* Vulnerabilities are not necessarily discovered and/or exploited
* But there is a risk thereof
* Risk contains
	* Occurrence probability
	* consequences
* Alternatives:
	* Leave (known) vulnerabilities AS IS
	* Eliminate vulnerability
	* Shut down complete IT-infrastructure
	* Choice depends on aims of the decision maker
	* If purely economic: Choose alternative with lowest expected mean cost
	* Practical problem: Occurrence probabilities and consequences are different to guess or estimate
# IT-Security as a Process
- Ensuring IT Security is not a singulary event:
	- New risks and vulnerabilities
	- New systems
	- Organizational changes
- IT-Security is a process and must be continually checked and adapted
