# Buffer Overflows
* Buffer Overflows is vulnerability of application allow attacker to inject his own code into application.
* Buffer Overflows is a vulnerability that occurs when a program tries to store more data in a buffer (temporary data storage area) than it was intended to hold.

# Vulnerability, [[Exploit]], Remote [[Exploit]]
* [[Exploit]]: (code to) exploit a vulnerability in a program/operating system by an attacker in order to compromise the system
	* Classification "How"
		* Local: Attacker need physical access or local user account(privilege escalation)
		* Remote: Over a network without the necessity of previous access to the system (and without interaction with human victim).
		* Web application, [[Zero-day]]
* Vulnerability: a weakness in a program/operating system that can be exploited by an attacker to compromise the system
* Remote Exploit: exploit that can be executed remotely (e.g. over the network)
