* Virus in IT security is a self-replicating [[malware]] that requires a host program to run. A virus can spread to other computers by infecting files on a network file system or a file system that is accessed by another computer. A virus can spread via [[Email]], [[IM]], [[P2P]], [[File sharing]], [[Networks]], [[USB]], [[Bluetooth]], [[IRC]], [[Malicious websites]].
* A virus can be designed to do different things. It can be designed to:
	* Spread as fast as possible and consume as much bandwidth as possible.
	* Spread slowly and avoid detection by consuming less bandwidth and not crashing computers.
	* Spread without being detected and do something useful for the attacker, such as install a backdoor to allow the attacker to control the infected computer remotely.
	* Spread without being detected and do something malicious, such as delete files or send data to the attacker.
* A virus can be used to create a botnet, which is a group of computers that a remote attacker has compromised and is controlling remotely.
* A virus can be used to create a [[DDoS]] attack, which is an attack that uses many computers to send traffic to a target computer to overwhelm it and make it unavailable to legitimate users.
* Viruses can be used to create a [[DoS]] attack, which is an attack that uses one computer to send traffic to a target computer to overwhelm it and make it unavailable to legitimate users.
* A virus can be designed to do something useful for the user, such as:
	* Allow the user to access a computer that the user does not have permission to access.
	* Allow the user to access a computer when the user does not
