* Worm in IT security is a self-replicating [[malware]] that duplicates itself to spread to uninfected computers.
* Worms often use parts of an operating system that are automatic and invisible to the user.
* Worms often spread by exploiting security holes in operating systems and computer programs.
* Worms can also spread by infecting files on a network file system or a file system that is accessed by another computer.
* Worms can spread via [[Email]], [[IM]], [[P2P]], [[File sharing]], [[Networks]], [[USB]], [[Bluetooth]], [[IRC]], [[Malicious websites]].
* Worms can be designed to do different things. They can be designed to:
	* Spread as fast as possible and consume as much bandwidth as possible.
	* Spread slowly and avoid detection by consuming less bandwidth and not crashing computers.
	* Spread without being detected and do something useful for the attacker, such as install a backdoor to allow the attacker to control the infected computer remotely.
	* Spread without being detected and do something malicious, such as delete files or send data to the attacker.
* Worms can be used to create a botnet, which is a group of computers that a remote attacker has compromised and is controlling remotely.
