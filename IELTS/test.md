Late night yapping,
It's been a long time since I felt such strong empathy toward content on the internet. Not because of the humor or the memes in the video (though they were great) but because of the bravery of a creator, a Vietnamese creator - someone who is really trying to criticise how permissive a lot of people are toward what they called art â€” if you can even call it that. Which, in the opinion of them, should be judged by the ability to entertain, not the the art for its own sake.
To be honest, I've not really watched this movie, so I won't say this movie is exceptionally good, or or that the praise this channel gives the film is true. But just look at the hate that it receives, just because ppl are unable to understand it on their first watch or because of the easy-going content that has been made to satify people's feelings about the film, makes me sad, honestly. Likes, what does that say about society now ?
