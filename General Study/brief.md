Food Studies presents the pedagogical opportunity for students to study and learn at the intersection of national politics and the everyday lives of people. As with bánh Tê ´t—a New Year specialty comprised of rice, pork, and banana leaves—a single dish can even symbolize the nation itself. Yet, as Nir Avieli well notes, the production of the dish—including the anxiety over the rice harvest, gendered labor investment, and regional modifications—ground it in lived daily life. Bánh Tê ´t thus is both the imagined taste of the nation and its gustative constituent parts (Avieli 2005).

The red string tied around the cake, known as câu đối đỏ, symbolizes good luck and wards off evil spirits. The bánh chưng is often offered on ancestral altars as a way to honor ancestors and seek their blessings for the upcoming year.

The Roles of Traditional Dishes in Cultural Celebration and Symbolism

In more Collectivist Vietnam, dishes like bánh Tét symbolize the nation itself and are deeply rooted in daily cultural factors reflecting regionalCollectivism like anxiety over rice harvests, gender roles and Particularism in ingredients (Avieli, 2005). Bánh chưng similarly holds significant meaning representing generations of Vietnamese Collectivist cultural heritage.

Culinary pedagogy highlightsCollectivism in transmitting values intergenerationally via dishes carrying symbolic Universalism tied to celebrations like Tet. Bánh chưng embodies symbols of prosperity, abundance and good luck during Tet (Asian Network Exchange, 2024).

In higher Individualist Germany, Christmas tradition emphasizes Collectivism through communal baking and enjoying various symbolic cookies and regional dishes. Stollen symbolizes the universal Christmas narrative through its shape while Christstollen reflects German Particularism.

Traditional dishes in both cultures play a unifying role fostering Collectivism. Family members exhibit strong Collectivism coming together to prepare and consume dishes that strengthen communal bonds during celebrations (Asian Network Exchange, 2024).

Distinct regional variations further characterize Vietnam and Germany's culinary landscapes. In Vietnam, the north-south rice availability Particularism is evident preferences like bánh chưng in the north vs bánh tét reflecting ingredient differences.

Similarly, German regions have own dishes reflecting local Particularisms for ingredients and celebrating traditions, such as Christmas goose in Bavaria and roast carp in the Rhineland. Traditional dishes thus act as carriers of Symbolic Universal meanings while representing cultural Particularisms through ingredients and celebration associations between the more Collectivist Vietnamese culture and higher Individualist German culture.
