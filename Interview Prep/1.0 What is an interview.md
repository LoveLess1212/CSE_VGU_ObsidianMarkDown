> It based around a question of **Do I want this person on my team??**

* It's not about Qualification and stats anymore as through the CV, they already knew it, no need to keep bragging about it
	* It more about interpersonal communication - not a place where we keep talking about ourself
* They'll want someone who
	* Impressive, but not arrogant
	* personable, but professional
		* Talk to the interviewer like a potential customer
	* someone who won't embarrass them

## How to address these
###  Impressive, but not arrogant
* About the experience that you have, GPA, work Experience but still keep humble and confident
* You better than someone, because of your accomplishment
### personable, but professional
* Smile
* Don't share too much
	* Kinda read the room, see what the interviewer vibe to twist your vibe
### someone who won't embarrass them
* Don't insult them :)))))
