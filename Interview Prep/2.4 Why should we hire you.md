>This question tests how persuasive you are. Interviewers want to see if you can make a calm, confident case for yourself, even if they're acting skeptical. They're looking for factual and compelling answers.
# Framework
This is a nerve-racking question, so make sure you're set up for success. Here are some tips that can help you do well in answering it:
## Ask yourself why you think you're qualified.
Prepare for the interview by picking three or four qualifications and experiences that help them understand why you're a fit for this job.
## Tell them how you'd fit in.
Paint a picture of what you'd accomplish that gives you a leg up on the competition. Also, show them why you are a great match for this company by letting them see that you know about their mission their vision, how they operate-and how you would fit into that really well.
## Speak authentically.
How you say something is as important as what you say. So when you're sharing your successes and you're answering these questions, speak like the best version of yourself and make sure that you're doing it in a way that allows the interviewers to connect to you.
# Tips
* Start with the three or four best reasons you've got.
