Microservice architecture is a software development style that breaks down an application into smaller, independent services. Each service is self-contained and has its own responsibilities.
* Services communicate with each other using well-defined APIs
* Each service runs a unique process
* Services are owned by small, self-contained teams

Benefit: make application easier to scale, Make application faster to develop, Enables innovation

in monolithic architecture, when a process experience a spike in demand, the entire architecture must be scaled.
