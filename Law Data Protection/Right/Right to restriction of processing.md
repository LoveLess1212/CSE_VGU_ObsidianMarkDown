> [[Data Subject|Data subjects]] are empowered to temporarily restrict a controller from processing their personal data
- [[Data Subject|Data subjects]] can request the controller to restrict processing where:
  - The accuracy of the personal data is contested
  - The processing is unlawful and the [[data subject]] requests that the use of the personal data be restricted instead of erased
  - the data must be kept for the exercise or defence of legal claims
  - a decision is pending on the *legitimate interests* of the data controller prevailing over the interests of the [[data subject]] right
- The controller can use the following methods to restrict personal data processing:
  - temporarily moving the personal data to another processing system
  - making the personal data unavailable to users
  - removal of personal data on temporary basis
- The controller must **notify** the [[data subject]] before the restriction is lifted
