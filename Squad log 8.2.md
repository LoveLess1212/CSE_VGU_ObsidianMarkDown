Also attempted to reduce instances where areas of thick concealment or urban areas lie between the first flags, which generally bog down attackers and cost them high amounts of tickets to clear. The 4th and 5th objectives will generally be more challenging to attack.  
        
    - Most invasion layers will no longer have forward vehicle spawns for defenders and will only have infantry spawns closer to the first objective.
