* Logical part of a computer network, where a broadcast reaches alll network devices that belong to that part
	* Devices, which operate on layer 3 (Routers) divide the broadcast domain
	* Devices, which operate on layer 1 and 2 (Repeaters, Hubs, Bridges, Layer-2-Switches) do not divide it
		* From the perspective of logical networks, they work transparent
* Broadcast doamins consist of one or multiple collision domains
* Routers operate at the Network
