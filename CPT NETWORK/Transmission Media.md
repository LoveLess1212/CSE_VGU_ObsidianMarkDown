# Coaxial Cable for 10BASE5
	 Expensive
# Coaxial Cable for 10BASE2 - thin Ethernet
* called *Thin Ethernet - ThinWire*
# Twisted Pair Cable
* very handy - very safe
* have 8 line in 4 pair -> dedicated line for sending and receiving
* **Is standard for copper-based IT networking**
# Wiring
* T568A and T568B are standard for the pin assignment of the Rj45 plugs and jacks and are used for fast Ethernet 100BASE-TX and Gigabit Ethernet 1000BASE-T
	don't matter which standard we follow, it still 1-1 connecting
# Crossover Cables and Patch Cables
* Crossover
	*  just a cable and **2** machine directly, connect pin and sending to each other
* Patch cables
	* Connect **more than 2 devices**
* Some Hubs and Switches provide an uplink port for connecting another Hub or Switch
	* The uplink port is internally crossed
# Complementary signal
	always have pair, atleast one pair for send, one pair for recei
* Via the wire pair a complementary signal is sent
	*  This allows the receiver to *filter out interfering signals*
	* + it *reduces electromagnetic emission*

# Shielding of different Twisted Pair Cables
* One of the diff of Twisted cable is shielding
* to *Prevent electromagnetic interferences*
* *label: XXYZZ*
	* **XX: the cable shield**
		* U = Unshielded, F = Foil shielding, S= Braided shielding, SF = Braided shield and foil 
	* **Y:  is the pair shielding**
		* U = unshielded, F = foil shielding, S = braided shielding
	* **ZZ: stands for twisted pair (TP)**
	* 
* Must be grounded on both side of cable.
	* If only one end of a shielded cable is grounded, an antenna effect occurs
* This results in a compensation current (l = V/R)
	* Compensation currents
## Categories of Twisted Pair Cables
* Different categories of twisted pair cables exist
* The performance of a network connection is determined by the component of the lowest category
* **Category 1/2/3/4**
	*  Not common to day
* **Category 5/5e**
	* Cat5e is guaranteed Gigabit Ethernet-compatible
		* It meets stricter test standards than Cat5 cables
	* Common in most current land
* **Category 6/6A**
*
| Category | Max. Frequency | Compatible with.                   |
| -------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Cat-6    | 250 MHz        | 5GABASE-T(5Gbps, 4wire pairs,100m) |
|          |                | 10GBASE-T()                        |
| Cat-6A   | 500MHz         |                                    |
* **Category 7/7A**
	* For Cat 7 and Cat 7A cables other connectors and sockets than RJ56 were initially intended
		* However, These connectors are not successful in the market
		* *Cat 7 and 7A cabling with RJ45 connectors offers no benefits over category cables
* **Category 8.1**
	* This standard supports cables of up to 30m in length
	* Cables of this length are mostly sufficient for data centers
