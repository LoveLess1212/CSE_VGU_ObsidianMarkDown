* All terminal devices are connected via a shared cable - the bus
* No active components between the terminal devices and the shared cable
	* If a node fails, it does not affect the network itself
* **advantage**: Cheap
* **Drawback**: shared cable fails, network fails
* Only a single node can send data at each point in time
	* Otherwise: collision will occur
		* A media control access like [CSMA/CD](CD) is required
