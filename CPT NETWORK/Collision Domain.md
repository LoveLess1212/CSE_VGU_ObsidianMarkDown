* Routers and Layer-3-Switches divide the collision domain
	* Exactly like Bridges and Layer-2-Switches do
> Device, which operate on Layer 1 (Repeater,hubs) do not divide the collision domain
> Devices, which operate on layer 2 and 3 (Bridges, layer-2-Switches, Routers, Layer-3-Switches ) divide the collision domain
