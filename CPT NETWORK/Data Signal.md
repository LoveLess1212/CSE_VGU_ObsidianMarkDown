* Data exchange takes place through the exchange of **binary data**
	* But the [[transmission media]] always transmit **analog signals**
* The signals are subject to physical laws
	* This includes the [[attenuation]] 
	* [[attenuation]] weakens the amplitude of a signal more and more over distance on all [[transmission media]]
		* If the amplitude of a data signal has dropped below a certain value, it can no longer be clearly interpreted
	* Thus, the [[attenuation]] limits the maximum bridgeable distance for all [[transmission media]]
> The **Higher** the **frequency**, the **higher** is the **[[attenuation]]**
