* Gateways are [[Protocol]] converters
	* Enable communication between networks, which base on different protocols
	* A Gateway can in theory operate on all layers
	* Gateways, which operate at the Network Layer, are also called **Multiprotocol Routers**
* Modern computer networks operate almost exclusively with the IP
	* For this reason, a [[Protocol]] conversion at the Network Layer is mostly not necessary
* In the past, in the network preferences of a terminal device, the IP address of the Gateway was specified as Default Gateway
	* Today, this filed contains the router address, because a Gateway is usually not required any longer
		* Thus, the term Default Router would be suited better

	* VPN-Gateways may operate on Network Layer
		* They provide secure access to remote protected networks( e.g intranet of a university or a company) over insecure public networks
		* Services (e.g. Email), which are only available inside the protected network can be used via a tunneled connection
