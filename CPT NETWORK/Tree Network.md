* One or more edges are connected with the root
	* Every edge leads to a leaf node or to the root of another tree
* Several star [[topology]] networks are hierarchically connected
* **Benefits:**
	* Failure of a terminal device (has no consequences)
	* Good expandability and long distances are possible
	* Well suited for searching and sorting algorithms
* **Drawbacks:**
	* When a node fails, the conplete subtree behind is no longer accessible
	* In a large tree, the root may become a bottleneck because the communication from one half of the tree to the other half always needs to pass the root
