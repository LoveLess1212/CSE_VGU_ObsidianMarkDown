* Routers forward packets between networks with different logical address ranges
	* Provide exactly like Hubs and Switches multiple interfaces
	* Enable to connect the local network (LAN) with a WAN(via DSL or 3G/4G mobile network)
* Layer-3-Switches are routers without a WAN interface
* G[[Gateways|ateways ]]are [[Protocol]] converters
	* Enable communication between networks, which base on different protocols
	* A Gateway can in theory operate on all layers
	* [[Gateways]], which operate at the [[Network Layer]], are also called Multiprotocol Routers
