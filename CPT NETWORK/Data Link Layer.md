# Function
* Sender: Pack packets of the [[Network Layer]] into frames
* Receiver: Identify the frames in the bit stream from the [[Physical Layer]] called [[Framing]]
* Ensure correct transmission of the frames inside a physical network from one network device to another via [[Error-detection Codes]] & [[Error Correction Codes]] with checksums
* Provide physical addresses ([[MAC address]])
* Control [access](obsidian://open?vault=Study&file=Media%20Access%20Control%20Methods) to the transmission medium
* Devices: Bridge, Layer-2-Switch (Multiport-Bridge), Modem
* Protocols: Ethernet, Token Ring, WLAN, Bluetooth, [[PPP]]
