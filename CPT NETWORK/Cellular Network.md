* Implemented by wireless networks
* **Cell:** Area where the nodes can communicate with the base station
* **Advantage:** Failure of nodes do not affect the network itself
* **Drawback:** Maximum dimension is limited by the number of base station and their positions
* Only one nodes can send data ata each point in time
	* Otherwise, collisions will occur
		* A media access control method like [CSMA/CA](CA) is
