[[CRC]]
* Transmission errors can be detected via [[CRC]] checksums
	*  If it is important also to correct errors, the data to be transmitted must be c=encoded in a way that error-correction is possible
* Error correction can be realize via Hamming :V
## Hamming code
### Position Parity Bits
* The bits of a bit seq are numbered starting with 1 from the left
	* Bits which are powers of 2 are parity bits
* The sender calculates the parity bits values
### Parity bit Values
