# CSMA/CD :V
# **CS** Carrier Senses
* Each network device monitors the channel before transmitting data, and it only transmits data when the channel is idle
* Thus, the network devices can distinguish between an idle and a busy cable
# **MA** Multiple Access
* All network devices access the same transmission medium in a competitive way
# **CD** Collision Detection
* Each network device also monitor the channel during transmission the order to detect collisions and to perform error handling when needed
