>Round trip time

Is the time it takes for a frame to travel from one end of the network to the most distant end and return back
This is used in CSMA/CD
The minimum transfer time of the frame must not smaller than the RTT this is used to ensure that collision message always reach the sender before the transmission finish.
If them finish -> everyone assume that the transmission is done and not come back.
