* Each node is connected with one or more other nodes
	* In al **fully connected mesh network** the nodes are all connted to each other
* if nodes or connections fails, communication inside the network is typically still possible because the frames are redirected
* **benefit:** Failure safe (depends on the cabling effort)
* **Drawbacks** Cabling effort and energy consumption
* Furthermore, in not fully connected mesh netowkrs, it is complex to identify the best way from sender to receiver during packet forwarding
