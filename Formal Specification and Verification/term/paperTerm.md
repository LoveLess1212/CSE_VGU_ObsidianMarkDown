diastrous: causing great damage
orthogonal: unrelated to each other
## qualitative feature:
* convergent-reliability: the reliability of "the software system that is under consideration" **increases** over time
* slender-reliability: the situation that only a constant number of inputs is incorrectly processed in the system at any point in time
    * any point in time: at any point in time during the execution of the system
## qualitative criteria:
* finite prefix deviation reliability: requires the software system to work fully reliably from some given point in time on.
* liveness-reliability: regardless of the state that the system is in, there always exists and input sequence such that the system will work correctly.
* strong livenes-reliability: requires the system to always work correctly "once in a while", regardless of given input
    * once in a while: at least once in every finite prefix of the execution of the system
