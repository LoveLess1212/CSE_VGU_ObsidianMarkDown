* model checking is an automated technique that, given a finite-state model of a system and a formal property, systematically checks whether this property holds for (a given state in) that model 
* Advantage
	* /based on a formal foundation and the applied techniques are mathematically proven to work
	* It allows for a partially automated verification which can be implemented in a tool
	* In case of property violations, it provides counterexamples which cna be use d to debug the system model
	* It has relevant applications (protocols, hardware, control software)
* Disad
	* The used formalisms have a very limited expressiveness, can only model some aspect
	* the accuracy sometime can not be correct
	* could fail bcs of time and space
