# Dimension
Britian coast 1,25 dimensional
Sierpinski triangle
Line - 1/2 length
Square - 1/4 area
Cube - 1/8 volume
## Mass
If you scale a line by 1/2 the mass is 1/2
If you scale a square A by 1/2 the mass is (1/2)^2 -> 1/4A
If you scale a square B by 1/2 the mass is (1/2)^3 -> 1/8B

If you scale a Sierpinski Triangle C by 1/2 -> mass is $1/2^x$$=1/3$C -> dimension approx 1.585
-> now we can find the dimension of the fractal
> this called self similarity dimension

If it not similarity dimension we can create a grid, check if it is in the shape

plot a li/ne, y is number of boxes touched, x is scaling factor
	 we will have a line  with function $c*x^(dimension)$
		Hard to get rid of c ->
			Logarith both size :V, plot again and find a slope

> Fractals are shapes with a non-integer dimension
> it stay rough even when you zoom in

Fractal
	Yes -> probably from nature
	No -> prob Human made :V

Maybe they have 2 type, closed one and open one
# 1st Idea:
draw depend on mass:
draw it multiply by mass.-.,
In case of Sierpinski triangle: mass when scale by $\frac{1}{2}$ is $\frac{1}{3}$ 
## Step
1. draw a nuclear element

:V fail
# 2nd idea:
- input: 
	- level: must
