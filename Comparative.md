Introduction
Culinary has long been a crucial part of human life. It is not only a source of energy but also a way to express culture and tradition (Brown, 2021).  While there are many studies on culinary traditions around the world, such as Liu et al.’s research (2021) on Japan’s culinary tradition and its impact on the tourist industry, and Tatjana Golikova et al.'s paper (2022) on the nutritional and health aspects of Eastern European culinary tradition, there is limited research on the comparison between the culinary traditions of different countries. This research aims to fill that gap by comparing the culinary traditions of Vietnam and Germany.
 This research will be conducted using a comparative research method to answer the question "How do the culinary traditions of Vietnam and Germany differ in terms of ingredients, cooking methods, and cultural influences?" The result of this research will be useful for people who want to learn more about the culinary traditions of Vietnam and Germany. It will also help them understand the differences between the two countries regarding food culture and tradition. 
The paper is organized as follows: section 2 describes the research method and data used, section 3 presents the results and section 4 discusses the findings.
Methodology
Many cross-cultural studies have long used comparative research to identify, analyze, and explain similarities and differences across societies and cultures. This makes it a perfect suit for our research about culinary traditions between Vietnam and Germany.
 The data come from various reliable sources such as books, and articles, and also the Food and Agriculture Organization Corporate Statistical Database (FAOSTAT) website which disseminates statistical data collected and maintained by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). We picked out the top 16 most consumed food categories in both countries and then put them into 2 bigger ones, namely: carbohydrate sources and protein sources, measured in kilograms per capita per year (kg/c/y) using the data from the latest year - 2021 (Attached compiled data table below). 
 Comparative analysis can be performed in many ways. In this research, we will use Trompenaars’ model of national cultural differences to analyze the data. This model is based on seven dimensions of culture: Universalism versus Particularism, Individualism versus Communitarianism, Specific versus Diffuse, Neutral versus Emotional, Achievement versus Ascription, Sequential Time versus Synchronous Time, and Internal Direction versus Outer Direction. Each dimension will be used to analyze a specific aspect of the data.
Results
This analysis reveals three key findings. First, the staple foods of Vietnam and Germany are rice and bread respectively. Second, the meals are prepared and served differently in the two countries. Third, the roles of traditional dishes in cultural celebrations respectively.
Staple food preferences between Vietnam and Germany 
The differences in food consumption between countries can be attributed to a variety of factors including geography, cultural differences, and economic conditions. One of the dimensions of Trompenaars’ model to understand more insightful understandings about this aspect more is “Universalism versus Particularism”.
Climate plays a significant role in shaping food consumption patterns in Vietnam and Germany. Vietnam is located in Southeast Asia and has a tropical climate, which allows for the cultivation of rice, cassava, and maize, which are staples in the Vietnamese diet (Harris et al., 2020). Germany, on the other hand, is located in Central Europe and has a temperate climate, which allows for the cultivation of wheat and potatoes, which are staples in the German diet (Stoll, 2018).
In addition to climate, geography also affects food consumption in other ways. For example, Vietnam has a long coastline, which makes seafood a significant part of the Vietnamese diet (Harris et al., 2020). In contrast, Germany is landlocked, which means that freshwater fish is more commonly consumed than marine fish (Stoll, 2018). Furthermore, the availability of certain foods can also be influenced by geography. 
Regarding how the Trompenaars' model can help to analyze food preferences in both countries more intensively to gain more insightful cultural differences, one of the dimensions that can be applied here is “Universalism versus Particularism”. In the context of food consumption, Universalism would imply a more standardized, global approach to food production and consumption patterns. In contrast, Particularism would focus on the unique traditions, preferences, and resources available in each specific country (Denis G, 2018).
Culturally, Vietnamese cuisine emphasizes balance with various flavors and ingredients used in their dishes - fresh herbs, and vegetables combined with either seafood or meat often steamed or boiled keeping the nutritional value intact. One of the most popular Vietnamese dishes that follow this pattern is Pho which is a popular Vietnamese noodle soup made with flat rice noodles, a warming broth, and usually chicken or beef. The flavor of this comforting noodle soup can vary greatly across the country, and many establishments load your table with sauces, herbs, and spices so you can season your pho exactly how you like it (Sudron, 2017).
On the other hand, German cuisine tends to be heartier with an emphasis on meats (43.26 pig meat compared to Vietnam’s 27.3), and bread (73.68 wheat products) reflecting both cultural preferences as well as agricultural outputs supported by its geography. One of the German dishes that represents this food reference is Sauerbraten. It is considered the national food of Germany, it’s made of meat, which is cooked slowly in the oven for hours and results in soft and tender meat that will give you an amazing culinary experience. Sauerbraten is usually served with potato dumplings, boiled potatoes or spätzle, Rotkohl (red cabbage), and sauce (Waltner, 2019).
In conclusion, both countries’ food consumption patterns are shaped by their unique geographical locations supporting different types of agriculture; historical development influencing culinary traditions; economic conditions dictating affordability & availability; but most importantly their particularistic cultural inclinations that honor traditional foods & preparation methods ensuring these patterns remain distinct & deeply rooted despite globalization trends.
Differences in meal preparation
Cooking Methods
Cuisine serves as a gateway to understanding the culture and traditions of a nation. German and Vietnamese cuisines offer a delightful journey into two distinct culinary worlds. While German cuisine boasts a strong baking tradition and hearty flavors, Vietnamese cuisine excels in delicate flavor balance and fresh ingredients. 
According to German Cuisine (2020), German cuisine showcases a diverse range of cooking methods, including sautéing, braising, and baking. The German baking tradition shines through in their famous bread varieties, pretzels, Black Forest cake, strudels, and seasonal delights like stollen and gingerbread. German cuisine is known for its hearty and rich flavours. Aromatic herbs like parsley and dill, spices such as nutmeg and caraway, and ingredients like mustard and vinegar are commonly used to enhance the taste of German dishes. These elements contribute to the robust and satisfying flavor profile that defines German cuisine.
According to Briden (2019), Vietnamese cuisine is celebrated for its mastery of stir-frying and steaming techniques. Stir-frying involves quick cooking in a hot wok with minimal oil, allowing the ingredients to retain their flavors and textures. Steaming is another prevalent cooking method used for dishes like rice rolls or fish, ensuring a light and healthy preparation. In contrast to the hearty flavors of German cuisine, Vietnamese cuisine relies on achieving a delicate balance of flavors. The clever use of fresh herbs such as mint and cilantro, the umami-rich fish sauce, the tangy lime juice, and the subtle heat of chilies create a harmonious blend of sweet, sour, salty, and spicy tastes. Vietnamese cuisine's flavor profile is characterized by its refreshing and vibrant qualities.
Preparation
Cuisine not only reflects the flavors of a nation but also embodies its cultural customs and social dynamics. Vietnamese and German dining traditions are distinct in their approach to preparation and consumption. While Vietnamese cuisine emphasizes fresh ingredients and communal dining, German cuisine focuses on hearty, slow-cooked dishes and individual servings.
Vietnamese meals are characterized by the intricate preparation techniques employed. Fresh ingredients take center stage, requiring meticulous chopping, marinating, and stir-frying to bring out their vibrant flavours. This attention to detail ensures that each dish is a harmonious blend of textures and tastes.  
German cuisine is renowned for its hearty and slow-cooked dishes. Methods such as grilling and roasting are popular, imparting rich flavors and tender textures to the food. The preparation process often involves patience and attention to detail, allowing the ingredients to develop depth and complexity. 
Differences in meal consumption:
Cooking Tools
It can be said that Eastern culture has strongly influenced Vietnamese meals since ancient times, with the most noticeable feature being the chopsticks that are most commonly used at meals. In ancient China, chopsticks were used for cooking for a long time and gradually evolved into the most important utensil at meals. The family members gather around the table and eat the food from the communal bowls with chopsticks, which encourages sharing and giving between the individuals at the table. Therefore, chopsticks are not only a tool for eating, but also a symbol of an Asian common meal that promotes harmony between people. 
On the other hand, Western peoples or Germans, unlike Eastern peoples in general and the Vietnamese in particular, have the habit of using a knife and fork at mealtimes. Since ancient times, the use of knives and forks not only served to differentiate between social classes but also had a practical significance for Western cuisine. Since German meals often include dishes with different textures such as meat or mixed dishes such as salad, a knife helps to cut the food into small pieces to make the meal more convenient, and forks make it easier to select the different ingredients in each bite and create a taste experience. For the reasons mentioned above, knives and forks have long since become social symbols of antiquity and sophistication of today. 
Dining Traditions: 
In Vietnam, meals are a communal affair and a cornerstone of social life. During meals, dishes will be placed at the center and whole family members enjoy the meal, it’s not only that, they would also like to talk about social life, and share the joys or challenges after a working day.  This communal approach signifies the collectivist nature of Vietnamese culture, where meals become a shared language of togetherness. 
But as shared plates are placed in the middle of the table, no specific portions are distributed on the plate or bowl, diners are encouraged not to eat too quickly and use up the others' portions, but also not to eat too slowly so that the others have to wait. Normally, if a member finishes the meal earlier than the others, it’s proper etiquette that he/she should wait for the others to finish and then finish the meal together. The Vietnamese have a habit of showing happiness by eating delicious food when dining with guests to show their gratitude and respect for the host, but always leave a little food on the plates to show that they are no longer hungry.  
In contrast to the Vietnamese dining table, Germans attach great importance to structure and personalization when it comes to their meals . Each member will most likely have their plate as their meal, not placing plates in the center like a Vietnamese meal, because by arranging the various ingredients on individual plates, you can determine the portion size according to your preferences and thus create a personalized dining experience. This approach is not only practical but also aligns with the German value of efficiency in daily life. Like Vietnamese, German meals are a time for family members to talk to each other and catch up after a working day. This is also an aspect that Germans attach great importance to because they see it as a way of bringing people together and strengthening a sense of community. 
In conclusion, the culinary traditions of Vietnam and Germany illuminate the intricate dance of intercultural communication. Vietnamese meals, with their emphasis on sharing and togetherness, contrast with the precision and personal space valued in German dining. Following the trend of globalization, nowadays, it’s easy to see the mixup of Eastern and Western on the dining table of Vietnamese or German families or even in restaurants. The delicate blend of food and eating habits brings interesting things to life, helping people interact and understand each other better, closer together. Whether in Vietnam or Germany, communicating, sharing and caring for family members at meals is always highly valued.
What Role Do Traditional Dishes Play in Cultural Celebrations?
The Roles of Traditional Dishes in Cultural Celebration
The intersection of national politics and everyday life is evident in Food Studies, where dishes like bánh Tét in Vietnam symbolize the nation itself. As noted by Nir Avieli, the production of such dishes is deeply rooted in daily life, reflecting factors like anxiety over the rice harvest, gendered labor, and regional variations (Avieli, 2005).
Additionally, bánh chưng in Vietnam holds a significant place in cultural habits, representing a connection to Vietnamese heritage through generations (Asian Network Exchange, 2024).
Culinary pedagogy is highlighted as a means of transmitting cultural knowledge and values, with traditional dishes acting as carriers of symbolic meaning tied to cultural celebrations (Asian Network Exchange, 2024).
In Germany, during Christmas, Germans have a rich tradition of baking and enjoying various types of holiday cookies, such as Lebkuchen and Springerle, which have symbolic shapes and designs. Additionally, there are regional specialities like Stollen in Dresden and Christstollen in Saxony, which are symbolic of the Christmas season and carry cultural significance. Stollen is shaped like a swaddled baby Jesus, and Christstollen is shaped like a manger (Waltner, 2019).
 Symbolism and Meaning in Traditional Dishes:
In both Vietnam and Germany, traditional dishes carry profound symbolic meanings tied to cultural celebrations. For instance, bánh chưng in Vietnam is associated with the New Year and embodies symbols of prosperity, abundance, and good luck (Asian Network Exchange, 2024).
Similarly, during Christmas in Germany, various traditional cookies and specialities like Lebkuchen, Springerle, Stollen, and Christstollen hold symbolic shapes and designs, representing the Christmas season and carrying cultural significance.(Waltner, 2019)
Conclusion
In the exploration of traditional dishes in Vietnam and Germany and applying Trompenaars’ model of national cultural differences, we have found that the two countries have many similarities and differences in different dimensions of culture. Vietnam's traditional food reflects a collective and emotional approach, merging families and communities. In contrast, Germany's traditional food reflects an individualistic and rational approach, emphasizing personalization and efficiency. However, both countries share a common value of connections, symbolic meaning, and adaptive regional variations.
